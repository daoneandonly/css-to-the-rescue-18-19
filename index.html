        <p>
          North Holland (Dutch: Noord-Holland [ˌnoːrt ˈɦɔlɑnt] (About this
          soundlisten), West Frisian Dutch: Noard-Holland) is a province of the
          Netherlands located in the northwestern part of the country. It is
          situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and
          west of Friesland and Flevoland. In 2015, it had a population of
          2,762,163[5] and a total area of 2,670 km2 (1,030 sq mi).
        </p>

        <p>
          From the 9th to the 16th century, the area was an integral part of the
          County of Holland. During this period West Friesland was incorporated.
          In the 17th and 18th century, the area was part of the province of
          Holland and commonly known as the Noorderkwartier (English: "Northern
          Quarter"). In 1840, the province of Holland was split into the two
          provinces of North Holland and South Holland. In 1855, the
          Haarlemmermeer was drained and turned into land.
        </p>

        <p>
          The capital and seat of the provincial government is Haarlem, and the
          province's largest city is the Netherlands' capital Amsterdam. The
          King's Commissioner of North Holland is Johan Remkes, serving since
          2010. There are 51 municipalities and three (including parts of) water
          boards in the province.

          Emergence of a new province (1795 to 1840)
        </h3>

        <p>
          The province of North Holland as it is today has its origins in the
          period of French rule from 1795 to 1813. This was a time of
          bewildering changes to the Dutch system of provinces. In 1795, the old
          order was swept away and the Batavian Republic was established. In the
          Constitution enacted on 23 April 1798, the old borders were radically
          changed. The republic was reorganised into eight departments
          (département) with roughly equal populations. Holland was split up
          into five departments named "Texel", "Amstel", "Delf", "Schelde en
          Maas", and "Rijn". The first three of these lay within the borders of
          the old Holland; the latter two were made up of parts of different
          provinces. In 1801 the old borders were restored when the department
          of Holland was created. This reorganisation had been short-lived, but
          it gave birth to the concept of breaking up Holland and making it a
          less powerful province.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1807, Holland was reorganised. This time the two departments were
          called "Amstelland" (corresponding to the modern province of North
          Holland) and "Maasland" (corresponding to the modern province of South
          Holland). This also did not last long. In 1810, all the Dutch
          provinces were integrated into the French Empire. Amstelland and
          Utrecht were amalgamated as the department of "Zuiderzee" (Zuyderzée
          in French) and Maasland was renamed "Monden van de Maas"
          (Bouches-de-la-Meuse in French).
        </p>

        <p>
          After the defeat of the French in 1813, this organisation remained
          unchanged for a year or so. When the 1814 Constitution was introduced,
          the country was reorganised as provinces and regions (landschappen).
          Zuiderzee and Monden van de Maas were reunited as the province of
          "Holland". One of the ministers on the constitutional committee (van
          Maanen) suggested that the old name "Holland and West Friesland" be
          reintroduced to respect the feelings of the people of that region.
          This proposal was rejected.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the division was not totally reversed. When the province of
          Holland was re-established in 1814, it was given two governors, one
          for the former department of Amstelland (area that is now North
          Holland) and one for the former department of Maasland (now South
          Holland). Even though the province had been reunited, the two areas
          were still being treated differently in some ways and the idea of
          dividing Holland remained alive. During this reorganisation the
          islands of Vlieland and Terschelling were returned to Holland and
          parts of "Hollands Brabant" (including "Land of Altena") went to North
          Brabant. The borders with Utrecht and Gelderland were definitively set
          in 1820.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the constitutional amendments were introduced in 1840, it was
          decided to split Holland once again, this time into two provinces
          called "North Holland" and "South Holland". The need for this was not
          felt in South Holland or in West Friesland (which feared the dominance
          of Amsterdam). The impetus came largely from Amsterdam, which still
          resented the 1838 relocation of the court of appeal to The Hague in
          South Holland.

          Urbanisation and economic growth (1840 to today)
        </h3>
        <p>
          After the Haarlemmermeer was drained in 1855 and turned into arable
          land, it was made part of North Holland. In exchange, South Holland
          received the greater part of the municipality of Leimuiden in 1864. In
          1942, the islands Vlieland and Terschelling went back to the province
          of Friesland. In 1950, the former island Urk was ceded to the province
          of Overijssel.
        </p>

        <p>
          In February 2011, North Holland, together with the provinces of
          Utrecht and Flevoland, showed a desire to investigate the feasibility
          of a merger between the three provinces.[6] This has been positively
          received by the First Rutte cabinet, for the desire to create one
          Randstad province has already been mentioned in the coalition
          agreement.[7] The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad
          urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province,[8] and very
          much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province,[9] is not
          named. With or without South Holland, if created, the new province
          would be the largest in the Netherlands in both area and population.

        <p>
          North Holland is situated at 52°40′N 4°50′E in the northwest of the
          Netherlands with to the northeast the province of Friesland, to the
          east the province of Flevoland, to the southeast the province of
          Utrecht, to the southwest the province of South Holland, and to the
          west the North Sea.
        </p>

        <p>
          North Holland is a broad peninsula for the most part, located between
          the North Sea, the Wadden Sea, the IJsselmeer, and the Markermeer.
          More than half of the province consists of reclaimed polder land
          situated below sea level. The West Frisian islands of Noorderhaaks and
          Texel are also part of the province.
        </p>

        <p>
          North Holland makes up a single region of the International
          Organization for Standardization world region code system, having the

        <p>
          As of January 2019, North Holland is divided into 47 municipalities
          (local government). After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles,
          three islands in the Caribbean, Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius,
          were offered to join the province, though the offer has been neither
          accepted nor rejected.[citation needed]
        </p>

        <p>
          North Holland has five municipalities with 100,000 or more
          inhabitants. They are, in order of size, Amsterdam (in terms of
          population this is also the largest municipality in the Netherlands),
          Haarlem, Zaanstad, Haarlemmermeer and Alkmaar. Another seven
          municipalities have a population between 50,000 and 100,000
          inhabitants (Hilversum, Amstelveen, Purmerend, Hoorn, Velsen, Den
          Helder and Heerhugowaard).

          De provincie kan worden onderverdeeld in een noordelijk en een zuidelijk
          deel, waarbij het Noordzeekanaal (en vroeger het IJ) als grens fungeert.
          De Nederlandse hoofdstad Amsterdam ligt in deze provincie, dit is ook de
          grootste stad van Noord-Holland. Ten zuiden van het IJ liggen de
          stedelijke gebieden van Amsterdam, Haarlem, de Haarlemmermeer met de
          luchthaven Schiphol en tevens Het Gooi, eveneens een dichtbevolkt
          gebied, maar met een landschappelijk geheel ander karakter (bosrijk en
          niet geheel vlak). De westkust van de provincie wordt grotendeels door
          duinen beschermd. Hier liggen bekende badplaatsen als Zandvoort, Egmond
          en Bergen. De streek tussen Haarlem, Velsen (aan beide zijden van het
          Noordzeekanaal), Beverwijk en Alkmaar heet Kennemerland. Ten het noorden
          hiervan ligt de oude marktplaats Schagen en op de noordpunt van het
          schiereiland de marinehaven Den Helder, tevens veerhaven voor Texel. Aan
          de oostkust liggen historische steden als Hoorn, Enkhuizen, Medemblik,
          Monnickendam en Edam en ook het eiland Marken en de opmerkelijke
          vissersplaats Volendam
